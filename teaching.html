        <h2>Teaching Philosophy</h2>
        <p>When it comes to teaching, I place a lot of emphasis on syllabus design and the learning environment. Whether I am planning for the entire semester or a single module on a given day, I begin by defining learning objectives and work backwards to determine assessment structure and how best to scaffold learning activities. I find that this provides students with clear expectations and an engaging use of class time. In terms of the learning environment, I consider factors beyond the scope of the material being taught. For example, I aim to design activities for students with a variety of personal motivations, prior background knowledge, and accessibility needs, and I regularly try to learn more about my students throughout the course so that I can adapt the learning environment in ways that might better suit the particular dynamics of a given classroom.

      <h2>Teaching Experience</h2>
      <h3>OEB 399: Topics in Organismic and Evolutionary Biology</h3>
      <p>Primary Instructor (2 semesters): Introduction to the doctoral program for first year graduate students. Learning goals include building cohort community, getting to know department faculty and campus resources, and professional pedagogical development.
      </p>
      <h3>LS 2: Evolutionary Human Physiology and Anatomy</h3>
      <p>Independent Section Head (2 sections): An exploration of human anatomy and physiology from an integrated framework of functional, comparative, and evolutionary perspective. Labs include animal dissection.
      </p>
      <h3>OEB 207: The Fishy Aspects of the Human Body</h3>
      <p>Teaching Assistant (2 semesters): Discover how the human body evolved over millions of years. Material follows the award-winning book, Your Inner Fish by Neil Shubin, and incorporates specimens from the vast collections at the Harvard Museum of Comparative Zoology. I taught this course once virtually during the pandemic where we created a specimen website to provide remote exposure to specimens and once after we returned to in-person instruction, integrating a pared down version of the specimen website with pre-pandemic teaching materials.
      </p>
      <h3>BIO 206: Human Anatomy Laboratory</h3>
      <p>Teaching Assistant (4 semesters): Introduction to cadaveric human gross anatomy. Course structure follows a systems approach (bone, muscle, nervous, and internal organs). Prepared prosections in advance of class time, and led student review of material directly using cadavers.
