        <h2>Teaching Philosophy</h2>
        <p>When it comes to teaching, I place a lot of emphasis on syllabus design and the learning environment. Whether I am planning for the entire semester or a single module on a given day, I begin by defining learning objectives and work backwards to determine assessment structure and how best to scaffold learning activities. I find that this provides students with clear expectations and an engaging use of class time. In terms of the learning environment, I consider factors beyond the scope of the material being taught. For example, I aim to design activities for students with a variety of personal motivations, prior background knowledge, and accessibility needs, and I regularly try to learn more about my students throughout the course.
        <br><br>
        In my teaching practice, I regularly employ hands-on, active learning techniques. I find that this is particularly important for the study of evolution and anatomy, both of which require the ongoing construction and refining of mental maps. Much of my pedagogical training comes from the <a href="https://bokcenter.harvard.edu/" target="_blank">Derek Bok Center for Teaching and Learning</a>. In addition to taking seminars during graduate school, attending the fall and winter teaching conferences, and pursuing the Teaching Certificate, I was also very lucky to serve as a Pedagogy Fellow for my department. During weekly professional development sessions, I had the opportunity to geek out on pedagogical literature with mentors and colleagues across departments and consult graduate instructors in my program as they developed their own teaching practices.

      <h2>Teaching Experience</h2>
      <h3>OEB 399: Topics in Organismic and Evolutionary Biology</h3>
      <p>Primary Instructor (<em>2 semesters</em>): Introduction to the doctoral program for first year graduate students. Learning goals include building cohort community, getting to know department faculty and campus resources, and professional pedagogical development.
      </p>
      <h3>LS 2: Evolutionary Human Physiology and Anatomy</h3>
      <p>Independent Section Head (<em>2 sections</em>): An exploration of human anatomy and physiology from an integrated framework of functional, comparative, and evolutionary perspective. Labs include animal dissection.
      </p>
      <h3>OEB 207: The Fishy Aspects of the Human Body</h3>
      <p>Teaching Assistant (<em>2 semesters</em>): Discover how the human body evolved over millions of years. Material follows the award-winning book, Your Inner Fish by Neil Shubin, and incorporates specimens from the vast collections at the Harvard Museum of Comparative Zoology. I taught this course once virtually during the pandemic where we created a specimen website to provide remote exposure to specimens and once after we returned to in-person instruction, integrating a pared down version of the specimen website with pre-pandemic teaching materials.
      </p>
      <h3>BIO 206: Human Anatomy Laboratory</h3>
      <p>Teaching Assistant (<em>4 semesters</em>): Introduction to cadaveric human gross anatomy. Course structure follows a systems approach (bone, muscle, nervous, and internal organs). Prepared prosections in advance of class time, and led student review of material directly using cadavers.
