    <h2>Minimum Convex Hull Mass and Center of Mass Calculation</h2>
    <p>
    <a href="https://github.com/awrightmark/MCH_MassCoM" target="_blank">Link</a> to GitHub repository.
    <br><br>
    This Python script takes body segments that have already been separated onto individual surface mesh files, wraps each in its own convex hull, and computes the mass and center of mass for each segment as well as for the whole body.
    <br><br>
    This script was used in the following publicatoin:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Wright MA</strong>, Cavanaugh TJ, Pierce SE (2024). Volumetric versus Element-scaling Mass Estimation and Its Application to Permo-Triassic Tetrapods. <em>Integrative Organismal Biology</em>. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/iob/obae034" target="_blank">Link</a></li>

    <h2>Correcting Inconsistent Euler XYZ Rotation Orders</h2>
    <p>
    <a href="https://github.com/awrightmark/MayaEulerCorrections" target="_blank">Link</a> to GitHub repository.
    <br><br>
    This R script corrects inconsistent Euler XYZ rotation orders across a data file by converting Euler coordinates into quaternion notation, which is independent of rotation order, and then converting quaternion notation back into Euler XYZ coordinates. The design provides seamless integration with existing Maya data processing workflow.

    This script was used for Chapter 2 of my dissertation, which will ideally be submitted and approved by May 2025.

    <h2>Comparing Morphogenetic Shape Data and Trajectories</h2>
    <p>
    <a href="https://github.com/awrightmark/MorphoTraj" target="_blank">Link</a> to GitHub repository.
    <br><br>
    These R functions assist in the calulation of morphogenetic trajectories for developmental series on morphospaces and provide pairwise Euclidean distance calculations for a priori defined groups or individuals on the morphospace.
    <br><br>
    This script was used for Chapter 3 of my dissertation, which will ideally be submitted and approved by May 2025.
