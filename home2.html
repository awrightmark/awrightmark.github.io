    <p>In the broadest sense, I am an anatomy educator and researcher (in that order). Every aspect of the human experience, from the food we eat to the sports we play to the relationships we nurture, exist because of bodies that create and shape the way we perceive and interact with the world. What fascinates me in particular about anatomy is the unknown, the unresolved mysteries. Naturally, this interest led me into the world of paleobiology. How did creatures like <i>Dimetrodon</i> or <i>Diplocaulus</i> navigate their environments? How did they use their respective sails and oddly shaped heads? In what ways did they interact with each other when they were alive?

    Outside of work, imagining worlds lives in my head rent free. From movies and video games to (on the more practical side) labor organizing, I am constantly enthralled by questions of "what if?" What if we lived in a country where labor unions had a powerful place in our government? What if life exists outside of our solar system? What if salamanders could fly? What modifications to their body plans could allow such a behavior, and what would it take for these features to evolve in a natural system? It might not seem like these questions are related, but I spend most of my waking hours fluctuating among them.

    In the research world, I have focused my early career thus far on developing the toolset needed to rigorously investigate complex biological questions. This toolset includes wet lab-based skills such as gross dissections or staining tissues, virtual modeling skills for simulating dynamic movement of anatomical structures and quantifying morphology in high resolution, statistical skills for addressing the challenging problem of shared evolutionary histories in trait modeling, and more. I have presented my research findings at numerous conferences and have authored two publications so far (with more in prep).
