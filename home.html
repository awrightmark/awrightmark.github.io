    <p>In the broadest sense, I am an anatomy educator and researcher (in that order). Every aspect of the human experience, from the food we eat to the sports we play to the relationships we nurture, exists because of bodies that create and shape the way we perceive and interact with the world. How do bodies work? Anatomy is the science of investigating how all of the constituent parts of a living organism work together to produce what we recognize as our Selves.
    <br><br>
    An emphasis of my research and pedagogy is the evolutionary aspect of anatomy. To me, evolution is what gives structures stories. It's one thing to recognize that humans have bipedal postures compared to other apes, and it's another thing entirely to consider <i>how</i> and <i>why</i> such a feature arose in the first place. Did our ancestors descend from the trees into ever-increasing expanses of African grasslands? It's certainly a believable narrative. I don't subscribe to an adaptationist-by-default philosophy for these kinds of questions. Evolution mostly just tinkers generation to generation with variation that is available within a population. It's less about finding optimal design solutions and more about finding solutions that are "good enough" to address a suite of constantly changing selective pressures. This framework makes it all the more exciting when strong evidence of adaptation is discovered.
    <br><br>
    Outside of academia, I am broadly interested in imagining worlds. I mean this in the fantastical sense of movies and novels but also in the activist sense - what is a better version of society that we can create, and how can we get there from where we are now? How can we live more empathetically towards each other and towards ourselves? My passions thus range from video game design to labor organizing, but it's all connected to a broader philosophical question that drives most of what I do: "What if?"
    <br><br>
    Within the research world, I have focused my early career thus far on developing the toolset needed to rigorously investigate complex questions related to evolutionary anatomy. This toolset includes wet lab skills such as gross dissections or staining tissues, virtual modeling skills for simulating dynamic movement and quantifying morphology in high resolution, and statistical skills for addressing the challenging problem of shared evolutionary histories in trait modeling. I have presented my research findings at numerous conferences and have authored two publications so far (with more in prep).
