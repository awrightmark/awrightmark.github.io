    <p>Hello! I am a PhD Candidate in the <a href="https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/spierce/home" target="_blank">Pierce Lab</a> at Harvard University. I am passionate about effective pedagogy and am learning how to become a better educator through the Derek Bok Center. In terms of research, I am interested in the evolution, function, and development of morphology. I primarily work with mammals and terrestrial tetrapods and am particularly interested in tracing our evolutionary lineage all the way through primates to modern humans. My skill set includes wet lab (gross dissection, tissue staining), digital 3D modeling (simulating dynamic movements, quantifying morphology in high resolution), and statistical (phylogenetic comparative methods, morphometrics) experience.

    More generally, I am broadly interested in imagining worlds. In an academic context, I like to think about animals long extinct and how they may have lived as well as the un-occupied regions of phenotypic space among extant diversity. Not just what exists, but what is possible? Outside of academia, I explore this interest in a variety of other ways, from exploring worlds within films, video games, and fiction novels but also in the activist ssense - how can we create a more equitable, inclusive, and diverse world for future generations than the one that exists today? How can we imagine it, and how do we get there from where we are now?
